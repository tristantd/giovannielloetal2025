<!-- Reproducibility reports should all use this template to standardize reporting across projects. These reports will be public supplementary materials that accompany the summary report(s) of the aggregate results. -->

## Introduction

[No abstract is needed.]  Each reproducibility project will have a straightforward, no frills report of the study and reproducibility results. These reports will be publicly available as supplementary material for the aggregate report(s) of the project as a whole.  Also, to maximize project integrity, the intro and methods will be written and critiqued in advance of your attempt to reproduce the results. Introductions can be just 1-2 paragraphs clarifying the main idea of the original study, the target finding for your reproducibility attempt, and any other essential information.  It will NOT have a literature review -- that is in the original publication. You can write both the introduction and the methods in past tense.  

The experiment I will simulate and reproduce comes from a paper investigating how distinct nuclei of the amygdala, and their projections to the striatum, support either action-outcome learning or habit formation and the disruption of these processes by stress. Chronic, mild stress perturbs these brain regions, impairing a mouse’s ability to exert volitional control over decision-making, as measured by two gold-standard assessments of goal-directed behavior: outcome-devaluation and contingency degradation. The experiments described by this paper are important for my research program because it is one of a few studies examining CeA-DMS projections. The DMS is a nucleus within the basal ganglia that has a role in the acquisition of goal-directed behavior that supports adaptive decision-making. The CeA is a nucleus within the amygdalar complex that has become a focal point of research on incentive salience. These regions, when investigated on their own, are compromised in disease states such as ethanol dependence, and investigating amygdalar-striatal afferents will provide knowledge on neural dysfunction of disrupted motivational and cognitive control over decision-making.

In order to simulate this experiment, I will look over the available behavioral data from the paper and record the means and variabilities for individual aspects (mouse, session, rate). These metrics will be important for how I will want to simulate datasets. 

The statistical analyses for the data will include multiple ANOVAs and t-tests to evaluate the effects of stress on performance across instrumental tasks and outcome devaluation assessments, as well as the neural mechanisms contributing to the shift, or rescue, of action control. A challenge in simulation is capturing the variability of animal behavior, since performance will change across sessions and response acquisition will differ between animals.

Prior to running simulations, I will attempt to reproduce the analyses reported in the paper using the available data. The authors used a statistical analysis software called Prism on all quantitative data. I will use a different analysis software called JASP since it is free. I will only focus on reproducing the experiments that I intend to simulate– the effects of stress and the effects of neural circuit manipulation on the shift in action control strategies. Specifically, I will reproduce and simulate effects of CeA-DMS inhibition and BLA-DMS activation on behavior in stress mice.

## Discussion

### Summary of Reproduction Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the key analysis and assess whether you successfully reproduced it, partially reproduced it, or failed to reproduce it.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis of the dataset, (b) assessment of the meaning of the successful or unsuccessful reproducibility attempt - e.g., for a failure to reproduce the original findings, are the differences between original and present analyses ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the reproducibility attempt (if you contacted them).  None of these need to be long.
